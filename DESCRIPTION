Title: Dynamic and Interactive Maps
Description: Dynamic and Interactive Maps with R, powered by 'leaflet' <https://leafletjs.com>. 'evolMap' generates a web page with interactive and dynamic maps to which you can add geometric entities (points, lines or colored geographic areas), and/or markers with optional links between them. The dynamic ability of these maps allows their components to evolve over a continuous period of time or by periods.
